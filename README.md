# WarCard
## Introduction
War Card is my first exposure to iOS development, and it is a 10-lesson tutorial I followed on YouTube with youtuber CodeWithChris. This project covers topics such as building user interface using Auto Layout, capture user ineractions using IBOutlet properties and IBAction methods, as well as the basics of Swift.

## Decription
When the deal button is tapped, a random card is displayed for player and CPU. Their score increments by one if one card is greater than the other.

## Technologies
* Xcode 11
* Swift 5.1

## Future Plan
As of now, there is no way to win the game. My future plan is to complete the game by implementing some logic to determine a winner and a scene to celebrate the win.
