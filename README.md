# WarCard

## Introduction
War Card is my first exposure to iOS development, and it is a tutorial I followed on YouTube with youtuber CodeWithChris. This project covers topics such as building user interface using Auto Layout, capture user ineractions using IBOutlet properties and IBAction methods, as well as Swift basics.

## Decription
War Card is a simple card game where player and CPU gets a random card when the deal button is tapped. The respective score increments by one for the card with greater value.

## Demo

## Future Plan
The tutorial did not cover how to implement a win scene, so there is no way to win the game as of now. My future plan is to implement some logic to determine a winner and add another scene to celebrate the win.
